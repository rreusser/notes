# LEARNINGS — dswap

## Translation Pitfalls
- Quick-return conditions must be preserved exactly as in Fortran reference to handle edge cases (N=0, alpha=0, etc.) correctly.

## Dependency Interface Surprises
- No BLAS/LAPACK dependencies — this is a leaf routine.

## Missing Automation
- N/A — translated via automated pipeline.

## Coverage Gaps
- Tests exist and validate against Fortran reference fixtures.

## Complex Number Handling
- N/A — real-valued routine.
