# dlartgp

> Generate a plane rotation (Givens rotation) with a non-negative diagonal.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var dlartgp = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/dlartgp' );
```

#### dlartgp( f, g )

Generates a plane rotation such that

```text
[  cs  sn ]   [ f ]   [ r ]
[ -sn  cs ] . [ g ] = [ 0 ]
```

where `cs^2 + sn^2 = 1` and the sign is chosen so that `r >= 0`.

```javascript
var result = dlartgp( 3.0, 4.0 );
// returns { c: 0.6, s: 0.8, r: 5.0 }
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **f**: first component of the vector to be rotated.
-   **g**: second component of the vector to be rotated.

The function returns an object with properties `c` (cosine), `s` (sine), and `r` (the non-negative radius).

#### dlartgp.ndarray( f, g, out )

Generates a plane rotation, writing the results `[cs, sn, r]` into a pre-allocated output array.

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array/float64' );

var out = new Float64Array( 3 );
dlartgp.ndarray( 3.0, 4.0, out );
// out => <Float64Array>[ 0.6, 0.8, 5.0 ]
```

The function has the following additional parameters:

-   **out**: [`Float64Array`][mdn-float64array] of length at least `3`. On return, `out[0] = cs`, `out[1] = sn`, `out[2] = r`.

## Notes

-   This is a more accurate (and slower) alternative to the Level-1 BLAS routine `drotg`. Unlike [`dlartg`][@stdlib/lapack/base/dlartg], `dlartgp` always returns a non-negative `r`.
-   If `g = 0`, then `cs = sign(1, f)` and `sn = 0`.
-   If `f = 0` and `g != 0`, then `cs = 0` and `sn = sign(1, g)`.
-   The algorithm incorporates iterative rescaling to avoid overflow or underflow for inputs with extreme magnitude.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var dlartgp = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/dlartgp' );

var r1 = dlartgp( 3.0, 4.0 );
console.log( r1 );
// => { c: 0.6, s: 0.8, r: 5.0 }

var r2 = dlartgp( -3.0, -4.0 );
console.log( r2 );
// => { c: -0.6, s: -0.8, r: 5.0 }
```
