# zlacn2: Translation Learnings

## Translation pitfalls
- Straightforward translation from Fortran reference.

## Dependency interface surprises
- N/A

## Automation opportunities
- N/A

## Coverage gaps
- Basic functionality verified via zgees integration tests. Dedicated unit tests not yet written.

## Complex number handling
- Uses reinterpret() for Float64Array views of Complex128Array data.
- Strides/offsets in complex elements at API boundary, multiplied by 2 internally for Float64 indexing.
