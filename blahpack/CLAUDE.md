# Blahpack — Fortran BLAS/LAPACK to JavaScript

Semi-automated translation of reference BLAS/LAPACK to idiomatic JavaScript,
conforming to [stdlib-js](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib) conventions.

stdlib-js reference clone: `/Users/rreusser/gh/stdlib-js/stdlib/`

  init_routine.py              #   Single command: scaffold + deps + test scaffold
  scaffold.py                  #   Module scaffold generator (stdlib-js structure)

## Commands

```bash
python                          # Use venv python (NOT python3)
gfortran                       # GNU Fortran compiler (Homebrew)
node                            # Node.js v24+ (node:test built-in)
node bin/gate.js <module-path>  # Quality gate for one module (all checks)
node bin/gate.js --all --fast   # Fast gate on all modules (file checks only)
node bin/gate.js --all          # Full gate on all modules (includes lint)
npm run report                  # Generate progress.html with conformance checks
bin/lint-fix.sh <module-path>   # Auto-fix (codemods + eslint + test verify)
bin/lint.sh lib/<path>/base.js  # Lint a single file
```

## Context Efficiency

**NEVER run these commands directly** — they produce 12,000+ lines of output:
- `npm test` — use per-module test runs with `| tail -20` instead
- `npm run check` — use `node bin/gate.js <module>` instead

**ALWAYS pipe test/lint/coverage through `tail` or `grep`:**
```bash
node --test lib/<pkg>/base/<routine>/test/test*.js 2>&1 | tail -20
bin/test-failures.sh              # Full suite — shows ONLY summary + failures
```

## Skills

Use these skills for translation and review workflows:

- `/blahpack-translate <routine>` — Full end-to-end translation checklist
  with all conventions, pitfalls, string tables, and quality gates.
  This is the primary workflow for translating a new routine.

- `/blahpack-review [module-path]` — Review a module (or full codebase)
  for convention violations, scaffolding remnants, and quality issues.
  Runs `node bin/gate.js` and applies the full review checklist.

- `/blahpack-scaffold <package> <routine>` — Generate module scaffold
- `/blahpack-signature <routine>` — Generate stdlib-js call signature
- `/blahpack-deps <routine>` — Show dependency tree
- `/blahpack-status` — Show translation status
- `/blahpack-coverage` — Run test coverage analysis

## Automation-First Mindset

Any manual work that repeats across routines is a bug in the tooling. If you
perform the same mechanical transformation twice, stop and automate it (new
transform in `bin/transform.py` or script in `bin/`) before continuing.

## Known Limitations

- Fortran `.f90` files that use modules (`USE la_constants`) cannot be
  compiled by `run_fortran.sh` without module compilation ordering.
  Work around: write JS tests with hand-computed expected values.
- **`deps.py` misses transitive Fortran-only dependencies.** Routines
  that call `ILAENV` transitively need `ilaenv`, `ieeeck`, `iparmq` in
  their Fortran deps file for test compilation. These are not JS
  dependencies (ILAENV is replaced with hardcoded constants), but
  `deps_<routine>.txt` must include them for `run_fortran.sh` to link.
  Check the deps files of similar routines when compilation fails with
  undefined references.
