# ztpmlqt

> Applies a complex unitary matrix `Q` (or its conjugate transpose) obtained from a triangular-pentagonal compact-WY block reflector — the output of `ztplqt` — to a stacked matrix `C` formed by two blocks `A` and `B`.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var ztpmlqt = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/ztpmlqt' );
```

#### ztpmlqt( order, side, trans, M, N, K, l, mb, V, LDV, T, LDT, A, LDA, B, LDB, WORK, strideWORK )

Applies `Q*C`, `Q^H*C`, `C*Q`, or `C*Q^H` (according to `side` and `trans`) in place on the stacked matrix `[A; B]` (left) or `[A B]` (right), where `Q` is the complex unitary factor produced by `ztplqt`.

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );

var V = new Complex128Array( 12 );
var T = new Complex128Array( 6 );
var A = new Complex128Array( 9 );
var B = new Complex128Array( 12 );
var WORK = new Complex128Array( 6 );

ztpmlqt( 'column-major', 'left', 'no-transpose', 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, V, 3, T, 2, A, 3, B, 4, WORK, 1 );
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **order**: storage layout (`'row-major'` or `'column-major'`).
-   **side**: `'left'` to apply `Q` from the left, `'right'` from the right.
-   **trans**: `'no-transpose'` to apply `Q`, `'conjugate-transpose'` to apply `Q^H`.
-   **M**: number of rows of `B`.
-   **N**: number of columns of `B`.
-   **K**: number of elementary reflectors.
-   **l**: order of the trapezoidal block of `V` (`0 <= L <= K`). `L = 0` reduces `V` to a rectangular block; `L = K` reduces `V` to a triangular block.
-   **mb**: block size used to construct `T` (must equal the value used in `ztplqt`).
-   **V**: pentagonal reflector matrix produced by `ztplqt`. Shape is `K`-by-`M` when `side='left'` or `K`-by-`N` when `side='right'`. Each row contains an elementary reflector.
-   **LDV**: leading dimension of `V` (`>= K` for column-major).
-   **T**: block triangular factor produced by `ztplqt`, stored as an `mb`-by-`K` matrix.
-   **LDT**: leading dimension of `T` (must be `>= mb`).
-   **A**: upper (left) or left (right) block of `C`, modified in-place.
-   **LDA**: leading dimension of `A`.
-   **B**: lower (left) or right (right) block of `C`, modified in-place.
-   **LDB**: leading dimension of `B` (`>= max(1,M)`).
-   **WORK**: workspace buffer (at least `N*mb` complex elements for `side='left'` or `M*mb` for `side='right'`).
-   **strideWORK**: element stride for `WORK`.

#### ztpmlqt.ndarray( side, trans, M, N, K, l, mb, V, strideV1, strideV2, offsetV, T, strideT1, strideT2, offsetT, A, strideA1, strideA2, offsetA, B, strideB1, strideB2, offsetB, WORK, strideWORK, offsetWORK )

Same operation as `ztpmlqt`, using alternative indexing semantics with explicit strides and offsets.

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );

var V = new Complex128Array( 12 );
var T = new Complex128Array( 6 );
var A = new Complex128Array( 9 );
var B = new Complex128Array( 12 );
var WORK = new Complex128Array( 6 );

ztpmlqt.ndarray( 'left', 'no-transpose', 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, V, 1, 3, 0, T, 1, 2, 0, A, 1, 3, 0, B, 1, 4, 0, WORK, 1, 0 );
```

The function has the following additional parameters:

-   **strideV1**: stride of dimension 1 of `V`.
-   **strideV2**: stride of dimension 2 of `V`.
-   **offsetV**: starting index for `V`.
-   **strideT1**: stride of dimension 1 of `T`.
-   **strideT2**: stride of dimension 2 of `T`.
-   **offsetT**: starting index for `T`.
-   **strideA1**: stride of dimension 1 of `A`.
-   **strideA2**: stride of dimension 2 of `A`.
-   **offsetA**: starting index for `A`.
-   **strideB1**: stride of dimension 1 of `B`.
-   **strideB2**: stride of dimension 2 of `B`.
-   **offsetB**: starting index for `B`.
-   **offsetWORK**: starting index for `WORK`.

## Notes

-   The pentagonal `V` is composed of a `K`-by-`(M-L)` (left) or `K`-by-`(N-L)` (right) rectangular block followed by a `K`-by-`L` lower-trapezoidal block (the first `L` rows of a `K`-by-`K` upper-triangular matrix). Reflectors are stored row-wise, so the block kernel `ztprfb` is invoked with `storev='rowwise'`.
-   The `WORK` buffer should provide at least `N*mb` complex elements (`side='left'`) or `M*mb` complex elements (`side='right'`). If the buffer is too small, an internal scratch array is allocated automatically.
-   `V` and `T` must come from a prior call to `ztplqt` with the same block size `mb` and the same value of `L`.
-   The `trans` parameter accepts `'no-transpose'` and `'conjugate-transpose'` only. Plain `'transpose'` is rejected because `Q` is unitary, not orthogonal.
