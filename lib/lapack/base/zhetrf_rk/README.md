# zhetrf_rk

> Compute the bounded Bunch-Kaufman (rook) factorization of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix in `_rk` storage format (blocked algorithm).

<section class="intro">

`zhetrfRk` factors

```text
A = P*U*D*(U^H)*(P^T)   or   A = P*L*D*(L^H)*(P^T)
```

where `U` (or `L`) is unit upper (lower) triangular, `P` is a permutation matrix, and `D` is Hermitian and block diagonal with 1x1 and 2x2 blocks. The diagonal of `D` is real-valued and stored on the diagonal of `A`; the off-diagonal entries of the 2x2 blocks are returned in the auxiliary vector `e`.

## Usage

```javascript
var zhetrfRk = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/zhetrf_rk' );
```

#### zhetrfRk( order, uplo, N, A, LDA, e, strideE, IPIV, strideIPIV )

Computes the `_rk` Bunch-Kaufman (rook) factorization of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix.

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );
var Int32Array = require( '@stdlib/array/int32' );

var A = new Complex128Array( [ 4, 0, 1, -2, 1, 2, 5, 0 ] );
var e = new Complex128Array( 2 );
var IPIV = new Int32Array( 2 );

zhetrfRk( 'column-major', 'lower', 2, A, 2, e, 1, IPIV, 1 );
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **order**: storage layout (`'row-major'` or `'column-major'`).
-   **uplo**: which triangle of `A` is referenced (`'upper'` or `'lower'`).
-   **N**: order of the matrix `A`.
-   **A**: input/output Hermitian matrix ([`Complex128Array`][@stdlib/array/complex128]). On exit, contains the factorization. Diagonal entries are forced to be real.
-   **LDA**: leading dimension of `A`.
-   **e**: output vector ([`Complex128Array`][@stdlib/array/complex128]) of length `N` containing the off-diagonal entries of `D`. Entries corresponding to 1x1 pivot blocks are set to `0`.
-   **strideE**: stride for `e`.
-   **IPIV**: output pivot index array ([`Int32Array`][mdn-int32array]) of length `N`. Entries are 0-based; 2x2 pivot rows are encoded as `~p` (bitwise NOT of the 0-based row index).
-   **strideIPIV**: stride for `IPIV`.

The function returns an `info` integer: `0` on success, `k > 0` (1-based) if `D(k,k)` is exactly zero (the factorization completes but `D` is singular).

#### zhetrfRk.ndarray( uplo, N, A, strideA1, strideA2, offsetA, e, strideE, offsetE, IPIV, strideIPIV, offsetIPIV )

Same operation, with full ndarray (stride/offset) semantics for every array argument.

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );
var Int32Array = require( '@stdlib/array/int32' );

var A = new Complex128Array( [ 4, 0, 1, -2, 1, 2, 5, 0 ] );
var e = new Complex128Array( 2 );
var IPIV = new Int32Array( 2 );

zhetrfRk.ndarray( 'lower', 2, A, 1, 2, 0, e, 1, 0, IPIV, 1, 0 );
```

The additional parameters relative to the BLAS-style API are:

-   **strideA1**: stride along the first dimension of `A` (in complex elements).
-   **strideA2**: stride along the second dimension of `A` (in complex elements).
-   **offsetA**: starting complex-element index for `A`.
-   **offsetE**: starting complex-element index for `e`.
-   **offsetIPIV**: starting index for `IPIV`.

## Notes

-   The implementation is a blocked driver: it calls `zlahef_rk` for full panels of width `NB = 32` and falls back to the unblocked kernel `zhetf2_rk` for the trailing submatrix.
-   `IPIV` follows the stdlib bitwise-NOT convention: positive entries indicate a 1x1 pivot whose target row is the value itself; negative entries `~p` indicate a 2x2 pivot block whose swap target is `~IPIV[i]`.
-   For Hermitian matrices, the diagonal entries of `A` are real-valued; the imaginary parts on the diagonal are forced to zero on exit.

var e = new Complex128Array( 4 );
var IPIV = new Int32Array( 4 );

var info = zhetrfRk( 'column-major', 'lower', 4, A, 4, e, 1, IPIV, 1 );
console.log( info );
console.log( IPIV );
