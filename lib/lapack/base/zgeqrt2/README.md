# zgeqrt2

> Compute a `QR` factorization of a complex `M`-by-`N` matrix `A = Q * R` (with `M >= N`) using the compact `WY` representation of `Q`.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var zgeqrt2 = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/zgeqrt2' );
```

#### zgeqrt2( order, M, N, A, LDA, T, LDT )

Computes a `QR` factorization of a complex `M`-by-`N` matrix `A = Q * R` using the compact `WY` representation of `Q`. On exit, the upper triangle of `A` contains the upper triangular factor `R`, the strict lower triangle stores the Householder vectors `V`, and `T` contains the upper triangular block reflector factor.

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );

var A = new Complex128Array( [ 2.0, 0.5, 1.0, -0.3, 3.0, 0.2, 1.0, -0.4, 1.0, -0.2, 4.0, 0.4, 2.0, 0.1, 3.0, -0.2, 3.0, 0.1, 2.0, -0.1, 5.0, 0.3, 1.0, 0.5 ] );
var T = new Complex128Array( 9 );

var info = zgeqrt2( 'column-major', 4, 3, A, 4, T, 3 );
// info => 0
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **order**: storage layout (`'row-major'` or `'column-major'`).
-   **M**: number of rows in `A` (must satisfy `M >= N`).
-   **N**: number of columns in `A`.
-   **A**: input/output matrix; on exit `R` is in the upper triangle and `V` is in the strict lower triangle.
-   **LDA**: leading dimension of `A`.
-   **T**: output `N`-by-`N` block reflector factor.
-   **LDT**: leading dimension of `T`.

#### zgeqrt2.ndarray( M, N, A, strideA1, strideA2, offsetA, T, strideT1, strideT2, offsetT )

Computes a `QR` factorization of a complex `M`-by-`N` matrix using the compact `WY` representation of `Q`, using alternative indexing semantics.

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );

var A = new Complex128Array( [ 2.0, 0.5, 1.0, -0.3, 3.0, 0.2, 1.0, -0.4, 1.0, -0.2, 4.0, 0.4, 2.0, 0.1, 3.0, -0.2, 3.0, 0.1, 2.0, -0.1, 5.0, 0.3, 1.0, 0.5 ] );
var T = new Complex128Array( 9 );

var info = zgeqrt2.ndarray( 4, 3, A, 1, 4, 0, T, 1, 3, 0 );
// info => 0
```

The function has the following additional parameters:

-   **M**: number of rows.
-   **N**: number of columns.
-   **A**: input matrix.
-   **strideA1**: stride of dimension 1 of `A` (in complex elements).
-   **strideA2**: stride of dimension 2 of `A` (in complex elements).
-   **offsetA**: starting index for `A` (in complex elements).
-   **T**: output matrix.
-   **strideT1**: stride of dimension 1 of `T` (in complex elements).
-   **strideT2**: stride of dimension 2 of `T` (in complex elements).
-   **offsetT**: starting index for `T` (in complex elements).

## Notes

-   The factorization is computed via Householder reflections (unblocked algorithm) and produces both `V` and the block reflector `T` in a single pass.
-   `Q` is implicitly represented as `Q = I - V * T * V^H`, where `V^H` denotes the conjugate transpose of `V`. The reflector vectors are stored in the strict lower triangle of `A` with implicit unit diagonals.
-   The last column of `T` (`T(:, N-1)`) is used internally as workspace during reflector application; it is overwritten before exit.
