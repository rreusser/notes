# zhetrd_he2hb

> Reduce a complex Hermitian matrix `A` to complex Hermitian band-diagonal form `AB` by a unitary similarity transformation `Q__H * A * Q = AB`.

This is the first ("stage 1") step of the two-stage reduction of a Hermitian matrix to tridiagonal form used by `xHETRD_2STAGE`. The routine produces band storage `AB` with bandwidth `kd`, plus reflector vectors and scalars (`A`, `TAU`) representing the unitary transformation `Q`.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var zhetrd_he2hb = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/zhetrd_he2hb' );
```

#### zhetrd_he2hb( order, uplo, N, kd, A, LDA, AB, LDAB, TAU, strideTAU, WORK, strideWORK )

Reduces a complex Hermitian matrix `A` to complex Hermitian band-diagonal form `AB`.

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );

var N = 4;
var kd = 1;
var A = new Complex128Array( N * N );
var AB = new Complex128Array( ( kd + 1 ) * N );
var TAU = new Complex128Array( N - kd );

var info = zhetrd_he2hb( 'column-major', 'lower', N, kd, A, N, AB, kd+1, TAU, 1, null, 1 );
// info => 0
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **order**: storage layout (`'row-major'` or `'column-major'`).
-   **uplo**: matrix triangle (`'upper'` or `'lower'`).
-   **N**: order of the matrix `A`.
-   **kd**: number of super-/sub-diagonals of the reduced band matrix.
-   **A**: input/output Hermitian matrix as a [`Complex128Array`][@stdlib/array/complex128]. On exit, contains the reflectors of `Q` outside the band.
-   **LDA**: leading dimension of `A` (≥ max(1, N)).
-   **AB**: output band matrix, dimensioned at least `(kd+1)*N` complex elements.
-   **LDAB**: leading dimension of `AB` (≥ kd+1).
-   **TAU**: output scalar factors of the reflectors, length at least `N-kd` complex elements.
-   **strideTAU**: stride length for `TAU` (in complex elements).
-   **WORK**: workspace. Pass `null` to allocate internally.
-   **strideWORK**: stride length for `WORK`. Unused — workspace is allocated internally.

#### zhetrd_he2hb.ndarray( uplo, N, kd, A, strideA1, strideA2, offsetA, AB, strideAB1, strideAB2, offsetAB, TAU, strideTAU, offsetTAU, WORK, strideWORK, offsetWORK )

ndarray variant with stride/offset semantics for `A`, `AB`, `TAU`, and `WORK`.

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );

var N = 4;
var kd = 1;
var A = new Complex128Array( N * N );
var AB = new Complex128Array( ( kd + 1 ) * N );
var TAU = new Complex128Array( N - kd );

var info = zhetrd_he2hb.ndarray( 'lower', N, kd, A, 1, N, 0, AB, 1, kd+1, 0, TAU, 1, 0, null, 1, 0 );
// info => 0
```

The function has the following additional parameters:

-   **strideA1**, **strideA2**: strides of the first and second dimensions of `A` (in complex elements).
-   **offsetA**: starting index for `A`.
-   **strideAB1**, **strideAB2**: strides of the first and second dimensions of `AB`.
-   **offsetAB**: starting index for `AB`.
-   **offsetTAU**: starting index for `TAU`.
-   **offsetWORK**: starting index for `WORK`.

## Notes

-   On entry, the relevant triangle of `A` (upper or lower) contains the Hermitian input. On exit, that triangle contains the band entries within `kd` of the diagonal, plus the reflectors representing `Q` for the entries further from the diagonal.
-   The Fortran reference uses an `ILAENV2STAGE` query to size the workspace. This implementation ignores the `WORK` argument and allocates scratch buffers internally (sized for the chosen block factor).
-   The "quick return" path triggers when `N <= kd+1`, in which case `AB` receives a direct copy of the relevant triangle of `A` and no reflectors are computed.

## Examples

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );
var reinterpret = require( '@stdlib/strided/base/reinterpret-complex128' );
var zhetrd_he2hb = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/zhetrd_he2hb' );

var N = 6;
var kd = 2;
var A = new Complex128Array( N * N );
var AB = new Complex128Array( ( kd + 1 ) * N );
var TAU = new Complex128Array( N - kd );

// (build a Hermitian matrix in A, then call the routine)
var info = zhetrd_he2hb( 'column-major', 'lower', N, kd, A, N, AB, kd+1, TAU, 1, null, 1 );
console.log( info, reinterpret( AB, 0 ) );
