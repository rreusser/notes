# dorgrq

> Generates an M-by-N real matrix Q with orthonormal rows from elementary reflectors returned by DGERQF (blocked algorithm).

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var dorgrq = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/dorgrq' );
```

#### dorgrq( order, M, N, K, A, LDA, TAU, strideTAU, WORK, strideWORK )

Generates an M-by-N real matrix Q with orthonormal rows from K elementary reflectors of order N, as returned by DGERQF.

```javascript
var dorgrq = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/dorgrq' );

var N = 3;
var A = discreteUniform( N * N, -10, 10, opts );
var TAU = discreteUniform( N, -10, 10, opts );
var WORK = discreteUniform( N, -10, 10, opts );

dorgrq.ndarray( N, N, N, A, N, 1, 0, TAU, 1, 0, WORK, 1, 0 );
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **order**: storage layout (`'row-major'` or `'column-major'`).
-   **M**: number of rows of Q.
-   **N**: number of columns of Q (`N >= M`).
-   **K**: number of elementary reflectors (`0 <= K <= M`).
-   **A**: input/output matrix.
-   **LDA**: leading dimension of `A`.
-   **TAU**: scalar factors of the reflectors (length `K`).
-   **strideTAU**: stride length for `TAU`.
-   **WORK**: workspace array.
-   **strideWORK**: stride length for `WORK`.

#### dorgrq.ndarray( M, N, K, A, strideA1, strideA2, offsetA, TAU, strideTAU, offsetTAU, WORK, strideWORK, offsetWORK )

Generates an M-by-N real matrix Q with orthonormal rows, using alternative indexing semantics.

```javascript
var dorgrq = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/dorgrq' );

var N = 3;
var A = discreteUniform( N * N, -10, 10, opts );
var TAU = discreteUniform( N, -10, 10, opts );
var WORK = discreteUniform( N, -10, 10, opts );

dorgrq.ndarray( N, N, N, A, N, 1, 0, TAU, 1, 0, WORK, 1, 0 );
```

The function has the following additional parameters:

-   **strideA1**: stride of dimension 1 of `A`.
-   **strideA2**: stride of dimension 2 of `A`.
-   **offsetA**: starting index for `A`.
-   **offsetTAU**: starting index for `TAU`.
-   **offsetWORK**: starting index for `WORK`.

## Notes

-   `dorgrq()` corresponds to the [LAPACK][lapack] level routine [`dorgrq`][lapack-dorgrq].
-   On entry, the `(m-k+i)`-th row of `A` must contain the reflector vector for `H(i)`, as returned by DGERQF in the last `k` rows of `A`.
-   On exit, `A` contains the M-by-N matrix Q.
-   `WORK` must have length _>=_ `M*NB` where `NB` is the block size (32).
