# dppequ

> Computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a symmetric positive definite matrix in packed storage and reduce its condition number.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var dppequ = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/dppequ' );
```

#### dppequ( uplo, N, AP, s )

Computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a symmetric positive definite matrix in packed storage and reduce its condition number.

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array/float64' );

// TODO: Add usage example
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **uplo**: specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part is referenced.
-   **N**: number of columns.
-   **AP**: input array `AP`.
-   **s**: `s`.

#### dppequ.ndarray( uplo, N, AP, strideAP, offsetAP, s, strideS, offsetS )

Computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a symmetric positive definite matrix in packed storage and reduce its condition number, using alternative indexing semantics.

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array/float64' );

// TODO: Add usage example
```

The function has the following additional parameters:

-   **strideAP**: stride length for `AP`.
-   **offsetAP**: starting index for `AP`.
-   **strideS**: stride length for `S`.
-   **offsetS**: starting index for `S`.
