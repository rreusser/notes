# dlarmm

> Compute a safe BLAS-style constant for scaling matrix norms

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var dlarmm = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/dlarmm' );
```

#### dlarmm( anorm, bnorm, cnorm )

Compute a safe BLAS-style constant for scaling matrix norms

```javascript
var dlarmm = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/dlarmm' );

dlarmm( 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 );
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **anorm**: anorm.
-   **bnorm**: bnorm.
-   **cnorm**: cnorm.

#### dlarmm.ndarray( anorm, bnorm, cnorm )

Compute a safe BLAS-style constant for scaling matrix norms, using alternative indexing semantics.

```javascript
var dlarmm = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/dlarmm' );

dlarmm( 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 );
```

The function has the following additional parameters:

-   **anorm**: anorm.
-   **bnorm**: bnorm.
-   **cnorm**: cnorm.
