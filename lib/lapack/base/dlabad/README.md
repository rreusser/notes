> Adjusts the underflow and overflow thresholds if the exponent range is very large (no-op on IEEE-754 machines).

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var dlabad = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/dlabad' );
```

#### dlabad( small, large )

Adjusts the underflow and overflow thresholds if the exponent range is very large (no-op on IEEE-754 machines).

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array/float64' );

// TODO: Add usage example
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **small**: `small`.
-   **large**: `large`.

#### dlabad.ndarray( small, large )
