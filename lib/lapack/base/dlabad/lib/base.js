// MAIN //

/**
* Adjusts the underflow and overflow thresholds if the exponent range is very large (no-op on IEEE-754 machines).
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   In LAPACK 3.12.0, this routine is a no-op kept for backward
*     compatibility. All modern machines are IEEE-754 compliant.
*
* -   The original behavior was: if `log10(large) > 2000`, set
*     `small = sqrt(small)` and `large = sqrt(large)`.
*
* @private
* @param {number} small - underflow threshold as computed by dlamch
* @param {number} large - overflow threshold as computed by dlamch
* @returns {Object} object with `small` and `large` properties (unchanged)
