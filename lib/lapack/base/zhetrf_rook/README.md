# zhetrf_rook

> Compute the bounded Bunch-Kaufman (rook) factorization of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix (blocked algorithm).

<section class="intro">

`zhetrfRook` factors

```text
A = U*D*(U^H)   or   A = L*D*(L^H)
```

where `U` (or `L`) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower) triangular matrices, and `D` is Hermitian and block diagonal with 1x1 and 2x2 blocks. Pivot selection uses the bounded Bunch-Kaufman ("rook") strategy, which performs an additional row/column search at each step compared to standard partial pivoting and produces stronger backward error bounds.

## Usage

```javascript
var zhetrfRook = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/zhetrf_rook' );
```

#### zhetrfRook( order, uplo, N, A, LDA, IPIV, strideIPIV )

Computes the bounded Bunch-Kaufman (rook) factorization of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix.

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );
var Int32Array = require( '@stdlib/array/int32' );

var A = new Complex128Array( [ 4, 0, 1, -2, 1, 2, 5, 0 ] );
var IPIV = new Int32Array( 2 );

zhetrfRook( 'column-major', 'lower', 2, A, 2, IPIV, 1 );
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **order**: storage layout (`'row-major'` or `'column-major'`).
-   **uplo**: which triangle of `A` is referenced (`'upper'` or `'lower'`).
-   **N**: order of the matrix `A`.
-   **A**: input/output Hermitian matrix ([`Complex128Array`][@stdlib/array/complex128]). On exit, contains the factorization. Diagonal entries are forced to be real.
-   **LDA**: leading dimension of `A`.
-   **IPIV**: output pivot index array ([`Int32Array`][mdn-int32array]) of length `N`. Entries are 0-based; for a 2x2 pivot block, BOTH entries are negative and each encodes its own swap target via bitwise NOT (`~IPIV[k]`).
-   **strideIPIV**: stride for `IPIV`.

The function returns an `info` integer: `0` on success, `k > 0` (1-based) if `D(k,k)` is exactly zero (the factorization completes but `D` is singular).

#### zhetrfRook.ndarray( uplo, N, A, strideA1, strideA2, offsetA, IPIV, strideIPIV, offsetIPIV )

Same operation, with full ndarray (stride/offset) semantics for every array argument.

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );
var Int32Array = require( '@stdlib/array/int32' );

var A = new Complex128Array( [ 4, 0, 1, -2, 1, 2, 5, 0 ] );
var IPIV = new Int32Array( 2 );

zhetrfRook.ndarray( 'lower', 2, A, 1, 2, 0, IPIV, 1, 0 );
```

The additional parameters relative to the BLAS-style API are:

-   **strideA1**: stride along the first dimension of `A` (in complex elements).
-   **strideA2**: stride along the second dimension of `A` (in complex elements).
-   **offsetA**: starting complex-element index for `A`.
-   **offsetIPIV**: starting index for `IPIV`.

## Notes

-   The implementation is a blocked driver: it calls `zlahef_rook` for full panels of width `NB = 32` and falls back to the unblocked kernel `zhetf2_rook` for the trailing submatrix.
-   `IPIV` follows the stdlib bitwise-NOT convention: positive entries indicate a 1x1 pivot whose target row is the value itself; negative entries `~p` indicate a 2x2 pivot block whose swap target is `~IPIV[i]`. Because rook pivoting performs an extra row/column search, the two entries of a 2x2 block can encode different swap targets (unlike the original Bunch-Kaufman variant).
-   For Hermitian matrices, the diagonal entries of `A` are real-valued; the imaginary parts on the diagonal are forced to zero on exit.
