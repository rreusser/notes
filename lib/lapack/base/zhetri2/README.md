# zhetri2

> Computes the inverse of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix `A` using the factorization `A = U*D*U**H` or `A = L*D*L**H` produced by [`zhetrf`][@stdlib/lapack/base/zhetrf] (classic Bunch-Kaufman). Dispatches between [`zhetri`][@stdlib/lapack/base/zhetri] (unblocked) and [`zhetri2x`][@stdlib/lapack/base/zhetri2x] (blocked) based on `N` versus the internal block size.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var zhetri2 = require( '@stdlib/lapack/base/zhetri2' );
```

#### zhetri2( order, uplo, N, A, LDA, IPIV, strideIPIV, offsetIPIV, WORK, strideWORK )

Computes the inverse of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix `A`.

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );
var Int32Array = require( '@stdlib/array/int32' );

var A = new Complex128Array( [ 4.0, 0.0 ] );
var IPIV = new Int32Array( [ 0 ] );
var WORK = new Complex128Array( 1 );

var info = zhetri2( 'column-major', 'lower', 1, A, 1, IPIV, 1, 0, WORK, 1 );
// returns 0
// A is now [ 0.25 + 0i ]
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **order**: storage layout (`'row-major'` or `'column-major'`).
-   **uplo**: specifies whether the upper or lower triangle of `A` is referenced (`'upper'` or `'lower'`). Must match the factorization.
-   **N**: order of the matrix `A`.
-   **A**: input/output [`Complex128Array`][@stdlib/array/complex128] containing the factored form of `A` from `zhetrf` on entry; the inverse on successful exit.
-   **LDA**: leading dimension of `A`. Must satisfy `LDA >= max(1, N)`.
-   **IPIV**: pivot indices from `zhetrf` (Int32Array). Non-negative entries are zero-based row indices for `1x1` pivot blocks; negative entries encode `2x2` pivot blocks via bitwise NOT (`~p`).
-   **strideIPIV**: stride length for `IPIV`.
-   **offsetIPIV**: starting index for `IPIV`.
-   **WORK**: workspace [`Complex128Array`][@stdlib/array/complex128]. Must be at least `N` complex elements when the unblocked path is used, and at least `(N+nb+1) * (nb+3)` complex elements when the blocked path is used (where `nb` is the internal block size).
-   **strideWORK**: row stride for `WORK` (in complex elements).

Returns an integer `info` value: `0` on success; `info > 0` indicates that `D(info, info) = 0` and the matrix is singular.

#### zhetri2.ndarray( uplo, N, A, strideA1, strideA2, offsetA, IPIV, strideIPIV, offsetIPIV, WORK, strideWORK, offsetWORK )

Same computation using strided/offset semantics (ndarray-style).

```javascript
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array/complex128' );
var Int32Array = require( '@stdlib/array/int32' );

var A = new Complex128Array( [ 4.0, 0.0 ] );
var IPIV = new Int32Array( [ 0 ] );
var WORK = new Complex128Array( 1 );

var info = zhetri2.ndarray( 'lower', 1, A, 1, 1, 0, IPIV, 1, 0, WORK, 1, 0 );
// returns 0
```

The function has the following additional parameters:

-   **strideA1**: stride of the first dimension of `A` (in complex elements).
-   **strideA2**: stride of the second dimension of `A` (in complex elements).
-   **offsetA**: starting index for `A` (in complex elements).
-   **offsetWORK**: starting index for `WORK` (in complex elements).

## Notes

-   `zhetri2` is a thin dispatcher: when `N` is at most the internal block size, it calls [`zhetri`][@stdlib/lapack/base/zhetri] (the unblocked variant, which only requires `WORK` of length `N`). When `N` exceeds the block size, it calls [`zhetri2x`][@stdlib/lapack/base/zhetri2x] (the blocked variant, which uses a larger workspace to leverage BLAS-3 GEMM/TRMM updates).
-   The Fortran reference picks the block size via `ILAENV(1, 'ZHETRF', ...)`. Following project convention, this routine uses a hardcoded value (`NBMAX = 32`); the workspace-query path (`LWORK = -1`) is not exposed.
-   On entry, `A` must contain the Bunch-Kaufman factorization of a Hermitian matrix as produced by [`zhetrf`][@stdlib/lapack/base/zhetrf].
