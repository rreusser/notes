I constantly forget how to use the various tooling of [Stdlib](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib), so here's lots of little notes in no particular order.

### Github bot

See [slash-commands.yml](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/.github/workflows/slash_commands.yml) for commands including

```bash
/stdlib [help check-files update-copyright-years 
  lint-autofix merge rebase]
```
